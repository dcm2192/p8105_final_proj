Import elk migration data.

```{r}
elk_df = read_csv("../clean_data/elk.csv") |>
  mutate(datetime = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour),
         elk_id = factor(elk_id)) |>
  select(elk_id, datetime, lat, long)

elk_df
```
The elk IDs are: `r unique(elk_df$elk_id)`, and we are going to follow them around Yellowstone! I found a cute picture of an elk in the snow  [here](https://powertraveller.com/yellowstone-winter-wildlife-safari-from-gardiner/)

## Exploratory Analysis of Elk Migration

Some questions we want to answer about the elk:

- Do the 17 elk move together as a pack or separately?
- Do the migration patterns change by year?
- Does time of year change the migration patterns?
- what is the average total length of yearly migration? daily? monthly?
- How wide or narrow are the migration routes?
- Are there any areas that all of the elk go to?
- are the elk likely to have the same paths or go elsewhere?

Fun stuff I want to do
- Make a moving map of the elk

Let's plot where the elk are on the map!

```{r}
elk_df |>
  mutate(year = year(datetime)) |>
 # filter(year >= 2014) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color = elk_id)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  facet_grid(~ year) +  
  labs(
    title = "Elk Migration by Year",
    x = "Latitude",
    y = "Longitude",
    color = "Elk ID"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75))
```

It looks like in 2013 the elk traveled much higher in longitude than the other years. In 2011, the elk did not go nearly as far North as in other years. Let's find out what the range was for the individual elk each year. 
```{r}
elk_df |>
  group_by(elk_id, year(datetime)) |>
  summarize(longitude_range = max(long) - min(long),
            latitude_range = max(lat) - min(lat)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Let's see how the sums across the months change.

```{r}
elk_df |>
  group_by(elk_id, year = year(datetime), month = month(datetime, label = TRUE)) |> 
  mutate(
    dist = distHaversine(cbind(long, lat), cbind(lag(long), lag(lat)))  # Calculate distance
  ) |>
  summarize(
    total_distance_km = sum(dist, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000  # Convert to kilometers and sum
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = elk_id, y = total_distance_km, fill = factor(month))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +  # Using bars to show total distance
  facet_grid(~factor(month)) +
  labs(
    title = "Total Movement by Elk and Month",
    x = "Month", 
    y = "Total Distance (km)", 
    fill = "Month") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```
Which elk that we have data for has moved the farthest?

```{r}
elk_df |>
  group_by(elk_id) |>
  mutate(
    dist = distHaversine(cbind(long, lat), cbind(lag(long), lag(lat)))  # Distance between consecutive points
  ) |>
  summarize(
    total_distance_km = sum(dist, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000  # Convert to kilometers and sum
  ) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)

# And maybe let's check how many data points we have

elk_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = elk_id, fill = factor(year(datetime)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Total Data Points for Each Elk",
       x = "Elk ID",
       y = "# of data points",
       fill = "Year") 
```
Let''s look at the daily averages and how this compares for each of the elk. We are going to only look at the interquantile range so we can see what the movement is like on most days. It looks like most days they move around

```{r}
daily_median = 
  elk_df |>
  mutate(
    dist = distHaversine(cbind(long, lat), cbind(lag(long), lag(lat))),
    date = as_date(datetime)
  ) |>
  group_by(elk_id, date) |>
  summarize(daily_sum = sum(dist)) |>
  drop_na() |>
  pull(daily_sum) |>
  median()
  
elk_df |>
  mutate(
    dist = distHaversine(cbind(long, lat), cbind(lag(long), lag(lat))),
    date = as_date(datetime)
  ) |>
  group_by(elk_id, date) |>
  summarize(daily_sum = sum(dist)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = elk_id, y = daily_sum)) +
  geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = daily_median, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Daily Averages (m)",
       x = "Elk ID",
       y = "Distance (m)")
```


Now let's look at how far they travel throughout the year. 

```{r}
#calculate the distance they travel each month
elk_seasonal <- elk_df |>
  mutate(
    year = year(datetime),  # Extract year
    month = month(datetime),  # Extract month
    season = case_when(
      month %in% c(12, 1, 2) ~ "Winter",
      month %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "Spring",
      month %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "Summer",
      month %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ "Fall"
    )
  ) |>
  arrange(elk_id, datetime)  # Ensure data is ordered

# Calculate distances and group by year, season, and elk_id
elk_distances_seasonal <- elk_seasonal |>
  group_by(elk_id, year, season) |>
  mutate(
    dist = distHaversine(cbind(long, lat), cbind(lag(long), lag(lat)))  # Distance between consecutive points
  ) |>
  summarize(
    total_distance_km = sum(dist, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000  # Convert to kilometers and sum
  ) |>
  ungroup()

# View results
elk_distances_seasonal |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = season, values_from = total_distance_km) |>
  knitr::kable()
```
Now I am curious what the overlap of the elk are? The data collected is between 2006 and 2015, but we do not have data from all of the elk ids during that time period. It turns out that wild elk can only live up to 10-12 years, according to [worlddeer.ord](https://worlddeer.org/elk/). So let's find out what the time range is for each of these elk.

```{r}
elk_df |>
  group_by(elk_id) |>
  summarize(start_time = min(datetime),
            end_time = max(datetime)) |>
  knitr::kable()

elk_df_2013.2014 = 
  elk_df |>
  filter(datetime >= as_date("2013-07-16") &
         datetime <= as_date("2014-12-30"),
         elk_id %in% c(907, 909, 911, 913, 914, 916, 917, 918))
```
The most overlapping data occurs between July 16th 2013 and December 30th, 2014. We have 8 elk that have data for this time range: `r unique(elk_df_2013.2014$elk_id)`. Now let's see how they move around!

Plot the seasonal data

```{r}
elk_monthly = elk_df_2013.2014 |>
  mutate(
    year = year(datetime),  
    month = month(datetime, label = TRUE),  
  ) |>
  arrange(elk_id, datetime)  

# Calculate distances and group by year, season, and elk_id
elk_distance_monthly = 
  elk_monthly |>
  group_by(elk_id, year, month) |>
  mutate(
    dist = distHaversine(cbind(long, lat), cbind(lag(long), lag(lat)))  # Distance between consecutive points
  ) |>
  summarize(
    total_distance_km = sum(dist, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000  # Convert to kilometers and sum
  ) |>
  ungroup() 


elk_distance_monthly |>
  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(month), y = total_distance_km, color = elk_id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1:12,  # Numeric positions for each month
    labels = month.name  # Use month names as labels
  ) +
  labs(title = "Elk Movement by Month 2013-07-16 to 2014-12-30",
       x = "month",
       y = "total distance (km)")
```
It looks like May and December are when the elk are moving around the most. 

I want to check if the number of observations for each month has an impact on these trends. I'm going to see if normalizing the data based on the number of observations has a significant impact on the trends. 

```{r}
elk_distance_normalized = 
  elk_monthly |>
  group_by(elk_id, year, month) |>
  mutate(
    dist = distHaversine(cbind(long, lat), cbind(lag(long), lag(lat)))  # Distance between consecutive points
  ) |>
  summarize(
    total_distance_km = sum(dist, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000,  # Convert to kilometers and sum
    count = n()
  ) |>
  mutate(normal_distance = total_distance_km/count)

elk_distance_normalized |>
  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(month), y = normal_distance, color = elk_id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1:12,  # Numeric positions for each month
    labels = month.name  # Use month names as labels
  ) +
  labs(title = "Elk Movement by Month 2013-07-16 to 2014-12-30",
       x = "month",
       y = "normalized distance")
```
The normalized data has a similar trend so we will continue with the raw data in km.

Let's see where the elk are moving around in the month of May.

```{r}
# Let's make a custom elk icon!!
elk_icon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "pics/elk_icon.png", # Replace with the URL of your moose image
  iconWidth = 30, iconHeight = 30
)

filtered_data = elk_df_2013.2014 |>
  filter(month(datetime) == 5)

# Create a color palette (limited to 9 elk IDs for "Set1")
elk_ids = unique(filtered_data$elk_id)  # Get unique elk IDs
num_colors = length(elk_ids)    # Ensure we don't exceed palette limit
path_colors = colorFactor(palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(num_colors, "Set1"), domain = elk_ids)

# Initialize leaflet map
map <- filtered_data |>
  group_by(elk_id) |>
  summarize(start_long = first(long), start_lat = first(lat),
            end_long = last(long), end_lat = last(lat))|>
  ungroup() |>
  leaflet() |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron, group = "Base Map") |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.NatGeoWorldMap, group = "NatGeo Map") |>
  addMarkers(lng = ~start_long, lat = ~start_lat, icon = elk_icon, popup = ~paste("Start Point: Elk", elk_id)) |>
  addMarkers(lng = ~end_long, lat = ~end_lat, icon = elk_icon, popup = ~paste("End Point: Elk ", elk_id))

# Add lines for each elk's path
for (elk in elk_ids) {
  elk_data <- filtered_data |> filter(elk_id == elk)  # Subset data for each elk
  map <- map |>
    addPolylines(
      data = elk_data,
      lng = ~long, lat = ~lat,
      color = path_colors(elk),  # Assign unique color for each elk
      weight = 2,
      opacity = 0.8,
      label = ~paste("Elk ID:", elk)  # Label showing elk ID
    )
}

# Add a legend for the elk IDs
map <- map |>
  addLegend(
    position = "topright",
    pal = path_colors,
    values = elk_ids,
    title = "Elk ID"
  )

# Print the map
map

```

Now let's look at the paths for December.

```{r}
filtered_data = elk_df_2013.2014 |>
  filter(month(datetime) == 12,
         year(datetime) == 2014)

# Create a color palette (limited to 9 elk IDs for "Set1")
elk_ids = unique(filtered_data$elk_id)  # Get unique elk IDs
num_colors = length(elk_ids)    # Ensure we don't exceed palette limit
path_colors = colorFactor(palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(num_colors, "Set1"), domain = elk_ids)

# Initialize leaflet map
map <- filtered_data |>
  group_by(elk_id) |>
  summarize(start_long = first(long), start_lat = first(lat),
            end_long = last(long), end_lat = last(lat))|>
  ungroup() |>
  leaflet() |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron, group = "Base Map") |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.NatGeoWorldMap, group = "NatGeo Map") |>
  addMarkers(lng = ~start_long, lat = ~start_lat, icon = elk_icon, popup = ~paste("Start Point: Elk", elk_id)) |>
  addMarkers(lng = ~end_long, lat = ~end_lat, icon = elk_icon, popup = ~paste("End Point: Elk ", elk_id))

# Add lines for each elk's path
for (elk in elk_ids) {
  elk_data <- filtered_data |> filter(elk_id == elk)  # Subset data for each elk
  map <- map |>
    addPolylines(
      data = elk_data,
      lng = ~long, lat = ~lat,
      color = path_colors(elk),  # Assign unique color for each elk
      weight = 2,
      opacity = 0.8,
      label = ~paste("Elk ID:", elk)  # Label showing elk ID
    )
}

# Add a legend for the elk IDs
map <- map |>
  addLegend(
    position = "topright",
    pal = path_colors,
    values = elk_ids,
    title = "Elk ID"
  )

# Print the map
map
```

## THERE IS SOMETHING WEIRD GOING ON WITH THE DECEMBER DATA
