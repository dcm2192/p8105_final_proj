## Motivation

We are motivated to study elk migration in relation to different environmental factors. We found this data by researching information related to national parks and landed on datasets from Yellowstone. Yellowstone National Park was the very first National Park established in the United States and also has the lowest level of biodiversity loss. We plan to look at environmental factors such as soil temperature, soil composition, and weather patterns that affect elk migration in Yellowstone.
