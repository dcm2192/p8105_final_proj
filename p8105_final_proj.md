## Tentative Project Title

Exploring Environmental Impacts on Elk Migration in Yellowstone National
Park

Exmaining Elk Expeditions: Migration to Yellowstone

Elk on the Move

## Motivation

We are motivated to study elk migration in relation to different
environmental factors. We found this data by researching information
related to national parks and landed on datasets from Yellowstone.
Yellowstone National Park was the very first National Park established
in the United States and also has the lowest level of biodiversity loss.
We plan to look at environmental factors such as soil temperature, soil
composition, and weather patterns that affect elk migration in
Yellowstone.

## Intended Final Products

- Website with landing page, about page, visulaizations, and dashboard
- Map showing migration of elk over time
- Comparison of elk migration with soil temperature
- Exploration of riverflow in yellowstone and elk migration
- dashboard/shiny app with interactive plots containing soil chemistry
  information
- plots analyzing the relationship between vegetation, elevation and
  temperature

## Anticipated Data Sources

Elk Data

## Planned Analyses/Visualizations/Coding Challenges

We plan to include an interactive map using elk collar data, as well as
a dashboard comparing elk data vs. soil temperature and elk data
vs. water quality.
